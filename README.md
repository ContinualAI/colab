# ContinualAI - Colab 
<img src="https://continualai.herokuapp.com/badge.svg">

**ContinualAI** is an open research community on the topic of Continual Learning and AI! :-)
We are building an open-source, collaborative wiki at [continualai.org](https://continualai.org) as well as creating a community of CL enthusiasts! Join us today **[on slack](https://continualai.herokuapp.com)**! :D

**ContinualAI - Colab** is a repository meant for tutorials and demo running on Google Colaboratory. The central idea is to collaboratively create a number of notebooks and scripts (for demo, showcasing & tutorials) which can be directly imported in Google Colab and are related to Continual Learning. Now, spread the power of Continual Learning! :-)
